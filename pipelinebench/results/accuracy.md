# Accuracy on real bugs: focused review passes, a held-out set, and a stricter judge

2026-10-19. The goal set for this round was 95% of real bugs caught, with 80% as the floor. This page says
where the review stands against that, measured on bugs it was never tuned on, and what the numbers rest on.

**The short answer: 60% on held-out bugs, short of the 80% floor.** Focused review passes more than doubled
recall on the same model (18% to 42% on the tuning set). Most numbers here come from Claude Haiku 5.5,
because the credit available for this round was $2.77. A later single run on Sonnet 5.5 through Claude Code,
on a subscription, also reached 60% on the held-out set, with more context in its prompt than the Haiku runs had (section below). Opus was not run.

## What changed in the review

- **Four focused passes instead of one.** `fathom review` now reads each change four times. Each pass has one
  focus: unusual but legal inputs, what the code's calls really do (language, library and protocol semantics),
  control flow and state, and contracts with callers and callees (`LENSES` in `src/fathom/review.py`).
  One pass asked to find everything stops at the first plausible problems. Four passes, each told to be
  exhaustive about one kind of failure, find what a single read skips. `--lens general` restores the
  single pass.
- **Shared context is cached.** The system prompt and the change are the same for every pass; only the focus
  differs. The Anthropic provider marks that prefix for prompt caching, so the three later passes read it at a
  tenth of the price.
- **Repeats are merged.** Copies with near-identical wording on nearby lines are merged in code
  (`merge_candidates`). The second reading also names any finding that repeats an earlier one
  (`duplicate_of`); the repeat moves to `rejected` with a note, so it is never silently lost.
- **A stricter second reading.** It reads at `high` effort (`review.verify_effort`, `--verify-effort`). It
  sets `holds` to false when an earlier check on the same path rules the case out. A new kind,
  `pre_existing`, covers a case that failed the same way before the change; like every kind but `defect`, it
  stops at `inform`.
- **New knobs.** `--effort` and `review.effort` set how hard the model thinks (default `medium`).
  `--lens` and `review.lenses` choose the passes.

## How it was measured

- **Held-out set.** `pipelinebench/review/heldout.yaml` holds 45 real bugs from eight repositories that are not
  in the tuning set: starlette, werkzeug, gin, chi, echo, ky, h3 and express (15 Python, 15 Go, 15 TS/JS).
  They were mined with `mine-introducers`, taken in mined order, and labelled by hand from the upstream fix
  before any review ran. No design choice was made by looking at them. The 50 bugs in `recall.yaml` remain the
  tuning set.
- **A model judge for "about the bug".** The `must_mention` word check gave false credit. A warning about a
  different problem counted when it happened to use one of the words: "certifi" matched `cert`, and a CIDR
  warning matched a scheme bug. `--judge-model` now asks a model whether each nearby finding names the
  labelled bug's root cause and failing case. A different problem on the same lines does not count.
  Re-judging kept raw reviews costs nothing extra (`--rejudge`). Every number below uses this judge.
- `recall-eval --jobs N` reviews several cases at once, each in its own worktree of the clone.

## Results

Claude Haiku 5.5, review passes at `medium` effort, one run per row.

- **Caught:** a warning on the bug's lines that names the bug.
- **In file:** a warning in the bug's file that is about something else. It shows the review looked in the
  right place, and it is not a catch.
- **Recall in file:** caught plus in file.

| build | set | caught | in file | inform only | missed | recall | recall in file | cost |

## Sonnet 5.5 through Claude Code (2026-10-20)

The same four passes on Claude Sonnet 5.5, run with `--provider claude-code`: through `claude -p` on a subscription, with no API key and no API spend. Unlike the Haiku rows, the files' CODEOWNERS owners (where a repository has the file) and their fix history were in the prompt (#38); no areas file was set. The history is read from the review's base, the parent of the commit that introduced the bug, so the later upstream fix is never in it. Judged by Sonnet 5.5. One run.

Read it with three caveats. The reviewer and the judge are the same model, as in the Haiku rows; the judge
only decides whether a finding near the labelled line describes the bug, and the outcome (warn or inform) comes
from the review, not the judge. The prompt carried more context than the Haiku runs, so the two rows differ in
more than the model. And it is one run, where two runs of one build differ by a few cases. The severity
reading below is where to look next, not a measured cause.

| build | set | caught | in file | inform only | missed | recall | recall in file | warns per case |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| four passes (`heldout-sonnet-claude-code`) | held-out 45 | 27 | 7 | 7 | 4 | **0.60** | 0.76 | 1.73 |

Recall is the same as Haiku's. What changed is where the misses sit. In 7 cases (`inform only`) Sonnet named the bug at its line but only at `inform`: gin's Hijack after headers only, `Unwrap` on the pointer type, echo's WebSocket X-Forwarded-For and h3's case-sensitive extension lookup among them, all four of which Haiku missed outright. One `in file` case (h3 080bf53d69) also named the bug at `inform`; scoring takes caught first, then in file, then inform only, and an unrelated warning sat in the same file. Only 4 bugs are missed outright (ky twice, h3's query decoding, express's `Buffer.byteLength`). On Sonnet, then, the likely lever is severity: the model or the second reading calling a real, concrete failure `inform`. That is a hypothesis from one run, to be tested over three. The run took about 17 minutes with `--jobs 4`.

Five cases record an empty `judge_usage`: no finding sat near the labelled lines, so there was nothing to judge
and the case is `missed` or `in_file` without a model call. Several matched findings carry a note that a `ref:`
evidence line was removed because it did not resolve; each still has a location and its diff evidence. The
removed refs point at lines in the full-file context the review shows, which the evidence check of the build that
made this run did not accept. This change fixes that: a `ref:` to a shown line of a changed file is now valid evidence.

For comparison, Sonnet 5.5 with one pass caught 21 of 50 on the tuning set under the word judge
(`recall.md`). The word judge credits several cases this judge does not.

**Noise.** The extra passes cost precision.

- **Planted bugs** (`review-haiku-5-5-passes-x1`): recall 0.98 (41 of 42 bugs) and 6 false alarms, on 4 of 19
  correct changes. Haiku with one pass had 1, and Sonnet with one pass 0. Most of the six are edge-case
  worries on code the labels call correct: a negative `limit`, a currency code in an unexpected case, a
  concurrent index build that fails half way.
- **Replay of 26 merged changes** (`replay-haiku-5-5-passes`): 13 warnings on 7 changes. Of those, 4 are
  plausible, 5 noise and 4 not yet judged. An earlier Haiku build had 3 noise warnings on 38 changes. The
  confirmed hono ETag bug was not caught.

The stricter second reading did not bring false alarms back down on Haiku. Whether a stronger verifier
does was not measured.

## What the misses are

On the held-out set, 9 bugs got a warning in the right file about something else and 3 stopped at
`inform`. Six were missed outright:

- gin Hijack refusing after headers only;
- `Unwrap` on the pointer type;
- echo's WebSocket X-Forwarded-For;
- ky reading a cloned body twice;
- h3's case-sensitive extension lookup;
- express's `Buffer.byteLength` on a Buffer.

On the tuning set, the misses that remain are mostly the kind the inputs pass targets: a case-sensitive
Bearer prefix, `\r\n` in SSE, a `#` fragment, an empty file read as missing. Haiku either does not raise
them or raises them at `inform`. Two runs of one build differ by a few cases, so a two-case gap means
nothing.

## What it would take to go further

- **Measure a stronger model.** Run the same design with Sonnet 5.5 or Opus 5.5 on both sets, three runs each.
  The prompts and passes are model-independent, and a stronger second reading is the likeliest fix for the
  false alarms. One Sonnet run of this design on one set is about $3 to $5, and Opus is roughly double.
- **Raise the effort of the passes.** On one case, `high` effort cost about three times `medium`.
- Then decide the default, passes on or off, from recall and noise measured together on that model.
